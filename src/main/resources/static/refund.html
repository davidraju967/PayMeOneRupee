        <p>This Refund & Cancellation Policy explains how refunds are handled for payments made on this platform.</p>

        <h3>1. Nature of Service</h3>
        <p>Payments made on this platform are for a digital recognition service where supporter details are displayed instantly after successful payment. Since the service is delivered immediately, standard cancellations are not applicable.</p>

        <h3>2. No Cancellation</h3>
        <p>Once a payment is successfully completed through the payment gateway, it cannot be cancelled by the user.</p>

        <h3>3. Refund Eligibility</h3>
        <p>Refunds are considered only under the following conditions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Duplicate payment made by the same user</li>
            <li>Technical failure where the amount is debited but the supporter name and rank are not displayed</li>
            <li>Payment processing errors caused by system issues</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Refund Process</h3>
        <p>To request a refund, users must contact us with valid transaction details such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Transaction ID</li>
            <li>Date and time of payment</li>
            <li>Registered contact details</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After verification, eligible refunds will be processed to the original payment method within 5–7 working days.</p>

        <h3>5. Non-Refundable Cases</h3>
        <p>Refunds will not be issued for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Incorrect supporter name entered by the user</li>
            <li>Change of mind after successful display</li>
            <li>Successful transactions where the service has already been delivered</li>
        </ul>
